This is the first paragragh about _Data Science_. It's new, ~~fresh~~ and and very 21st Century. Keep reading for more information.

The first thing to know about Data Science is that it's a mixed between **statistics, coding and math**. It's a very exciting field.

## The center of the three circles

People who know how to code, statistics and math are very specific people. For this reason, Data Scientists are hard to find.
Companies are spending a lot of money to develop more DSc because our technologic world needs people able to model our world.
Technology has enable data acquisition. Now there isn't enough people able to read it.

### Learning and teaching DSc

> 
>"Sharing is caring" Always share your code, help others and others will help you!
> 

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

```python
// Python syntax for your projects
def writeHello():
    print('Hello')
    
writeHello()

```


#### Remember to do this every day:

*   Work on a DSc project.
*   Read something new related to DSc.
*   Document your work so others can use it.

##### Set priorities

1.  Choose a topic for each week and become an expert.
2.  Find themes that interest you.
3.  Ask other people in the field their comments and Update!

###### Am I moving forward?

Yes = 3 points
No = 0 points

Example:

| Ask yourself | Yes or No         | Points |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Min 1 project| Yes | 3  |
| Min 1 article| Yes  | n3  |
| Documented   | No     | 0   |
| Talked someone | No | 0  |

Total `Score of 6`.

If your `score` is > 9, you are making a LOT of progress. Congratulations!
If your `score` is 3 > score > 9, great progress - increase the bar.
If your score is < 3, you are only dreaming. Reserve dedicated spots in your week to work in each of these areas.

* * *

### Remember, you can do this! You only need:

*   Time organization
*   Fight your fears
*   Talk others about your work

### Here are different areas you can work on weekly:

1.  Extracting raw data
1.  Reading data
1.  Cleaning data
1.  Analyzing data
1.  Visualizing data
1.  Testing models
1.  Document models

### Every project needs to be complete:

- Well documented
  - Can you just open it and run it?
  - Is the accuracy dependant of time?
    - Will it change with other types of data?
    - Are you managing data control?
- Are you happy with the results?
  - Does it cover the project goals?
  - Can you expand the model?
  - Can be reused?
